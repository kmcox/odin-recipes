    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375Â°. On a lightly floured surface, 
            roll half of the dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle; 
            transfer to a 9-in. pie plate. Chill while preparing 
            filling. In a small bowl, combine sugars, flour and spices.
            In a large bowl, toss apples with lemon juice. 
             Add sugar mixture; toss to coat. 
             Add filling; dot with butter.</li>
        <li>Roll remaining dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle. 
            Place over filling. Trim, seal and flute edge. Cut slits in top.
             Beat egg white until foamy; brush over crust. 
             If desired, sprinkle with turbinado sugar and ground cinnamon.</li>
        <li>Bake on the lowest rack 60-70 minutes, 
            until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly, 
            covering with foil halfway if crust begins to get too dark.
             Cool on a wire rack. If desired, 
             serve with ice cream and caramel sauce.</li>
    </ol>
